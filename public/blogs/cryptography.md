# Important terms and their meaning

- Key : Used to lock and unlock data using either a random string of bits or custom string of bits.
- Bits : A logical state with one of two possible values, including 1/0, true/false, yes/no, or on/off as typical examples.
- Hash function : The algorithm that uses the key to create encryption and decryption. It will be fixed size output.
- Hash : Output of hash function. 
- Cipher : An algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt information. Output will be variable.
- Ciphertext : A scramble or unreadable text generated by using a cryptographic algorithm for a given readable text. Simply output of cipher.
- Stream : A sequence of bits.

### 1. Symmetric key cryptography (private key cryptography)
Symmetric key encryption uses only one key for both the encryption process and decryption process. For these types of systems, each user must have access to the same private key.
Private keys might be shared either through a previously established secure communication.

#### Types of symmetric key algorithms

#### 1. Stream Cipher:
It encrypts data bit by bit or byte by byte using a key stream where a key stream is generated from a key. It produce ciphertext by combining each bit/byte from a 
plain readable text with key stream (basically XOR). This type of algorithm mostly used of encrypting real time data like audio/video call. Most commonly used algorithms are 
Rivest Cipher 4, Salsa20, ChaCha20, Trivium, Grain, CryptMT and Fibonnaci Shrinking.

#### 2. Block Cipher:
It encrypt data in a fixed block length. It works by dividing plaintext into fixed block where each block is encrypted separately using chained mode (Mode of operations).
Padding may be added if the block is not full. Mostly used in file storage and ssl. Most commonly used algorithms are AES and DES.

##### (We will dive deeper into the algorithms a bit later)

#### 2.Asymmetric key cryptography (public key algorithms)
In asymmetric encryption, a pair of keys is used one secret key and one public key. 
For this reason, these algorithms are also referred to as public key algorithms. Public key cryptography is considered to be more secure than symmetric encryption techniques 
because even though one key is publicly available an encrypted message can only be decrypted with the intended recipientâ€™s private key.
This type of algorithm are used in digital ID system, Digital Signatures (APK,PDF). Commonly used algorithms are RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm and Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

#### 3.Hashing
Hashing produces a fixed-length output string from a variable-length input string. The input serves as the plaintext and the output hash is the cipher. Hash algorithms make for effective 
cryptosystems because the hash algorithm encrypts the data directly without the need for different keys. In essence, the plaintext is its own key. Once plaintext is encrypted it cannot be 
decrypted so it is a one way process.Most commonly used algorithms are md5 and SHA.
